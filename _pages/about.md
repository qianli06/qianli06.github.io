I'm a master's student from [School of Electronics](https://ele.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Wireless Communication and Sensing, Machine Learning, Reconfigurable Meta-material Anttanas, Distributed Radar Systems and Information and Coding Theory.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Dou Li](https://ele.pku.edu.cn/info/1122/1432.htm) and [Prof. Hongliang Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oMuKmN0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) from [School of Electronics](https://ele.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.

I am very fortunate to be guided by  [Prof. Renjie Zhao](https://renjiezhao.github.io/) in conducting research on human-centered wireless sensing.

Feel free to contact me anytime！
